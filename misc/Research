Airbnb is a marketplace where travellers get to stay at the property listed on the site by the local hosts. Airbnb is based on an aggregator business model. 

Aggregator Business Model is a network model where the company collects the data about a specific good/service providers, make the providers their partners, and sell their services under its brand
People having vacant space at their home and willing to earn some extra money can list their rooms on the website and earn some extra bucks. Airbnb also has personal profiles and rating/reviewing systems that help the travellers.They visit a property and get high-definition photographs of the property. These high-definition photographs improve the click-rate and help in getting more responses.
