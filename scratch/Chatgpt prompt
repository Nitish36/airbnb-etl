It would be my pleasure to host them again anytime. They left the place so spotless; I could not even tell if they stayed in the home! Thanks so much! I sincerely hope to host you again,
They were easy to communicate with and left the space in excellent condition. We would be happy to host them again.]

house_rules --> [Clean up and treat the home the way you'd like your home to be treated,
 No smoking,
 Pet friendly but please confirm with me if the pet you are planning on bringing with you is OK. I have a cute and quiet mixed chihuahua. I could accept more guests (for an extra fee) but this also needs to be confirmed beforehand. Also friends traveling together could sleep in separate beds for an extra fee (the second bed is either a sofa bed or inflatable bed). Smoking is only allowed on the porch.,
 My ideal guests would be warm, friendly, and respectful of sharing my home and it's rhythms. I am allergic to cigarettes, so no smoking please, not even in the yard. A quiet homecoming is much appreciated at the end of the evening's nightlife.
